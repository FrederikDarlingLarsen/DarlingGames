    <h2>Cat-Burrito: The Quest For Margaritas (2024)</h2>
    <div class="container"><img class="portfolio"  src="images/catBurr.jpg" alt="roller"></div>
    
    <p>This the main game we are currently working on at Darling Games. The game will be delayed, since Frederik Darling will be busy with a new job
       as a software developer. The plan is still to eventually continue development of the game and release it. The plan right now is that a Demo 
       will release in 2023 and that the final game will probably release in 2024.
    </p>

    <p>The game follows Cat-Burrito who loves to drink margaritas. The player gets to explore 3 differnt worlds with featuring varied missions that will
      give ingredients as rewards. These ingredients can then be brought to a bar to make drinks. These driknks act as the main collectables in the game
      that can be used to unlock new parts of the game. The player will also be able to upgrade their abillities throughout the game, adding new
      mechanics to the mix. To mix up the gameplay the player can also collect tokens that can be brought to the arcade to unlock classic arcade-style games
      that can be enjoyed when the player needs a break from the main game.
    </p>

    <p>The game is a 3D collectathon platformer that harkens back to platformers from the 90's like Banjo-Kazooie and Super Mario 64. The player of those games
       will recognize some game elements like the main collectables that unlock new worlds and the many missions that is scattered throughout varied open worlds.
    </p>

    <h2>Christmas Land (2022)</h2>
    <div class="container"><iframe class="youTube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zR3ghcs8890" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
    <p>Santa Claus went insane and then the people killed him but Krampus actually liked the insane Santa Claus so he's going to wake him 
       back to life so he put his arm down through the Chimneys and promises kids that they can go to Christmas Land. The game is 
       based on the story "Christmas Land" by Elias Witherow.
      </p>
     <p>
      Press buildings with the mouse to steal kids then go to Christmas land by pressing "E" and grind them up for energy. For every kid
      that is grinded up you recieve bones and fill up the energy meter. When the energy meter reaches 10 it is time for Santa to wake up. 
    </p>
      <p>
        The game was the developed at the AAU Fall Jam 2022 by two people, where the theme was Harvest and the wildcard was the number 10.
         The theme was fulfillled by interpreting harvest as the harvest of the bodies of kids, with the number 10 being the goal that
         you need to reach in order to wake up Santa.
    </p>

    <h2>Another Bullet Hell (2022)</h2>
    <div class="container"><iframe class="youTube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W2v8jQsP9DI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
    <p>This was a simple bullet hell-style shoot-em-up game that was developed by me exclusively over a couple of weeks. The inspiration to develop a bullet hell shooter
      came from a bullet hell jam that was posted on itch.io. The game is rather simple with only 3 enemy types that appear in difffet quntitiy depanst on
      the current level. The game is beat after the player gets to level (). 
    </p>

    <p>  
      The gameplay is quite striaght forward. The player start out with only one weapon which only shoots one bullet. When the player beats the fisrt level they given a spread gun 
      and after beating the next the  are given the ability the throw bombs. The spread gun is by far the most effective weapon since it shoote five bullet at once
      which are spread out. I demo that has been amde so far there are three enemy types.
    </p>

      <p> The game will appear as a part of the arcade in Cat-Burrito: The Quest For Margaritas. Here the game may be updated with more enemy types and at least one boss fight. 
        Beating The game in the Cat-Burrito arcade with unlock and achivement along with a specail abillity for the player to use in the main game.

    <h2>Eco-Frog (2022)</h2>
    <div class="container"><iframe class="youTube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TF2mgvq-HMk" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
    <p>This game was developed on the Game Design course i took on the sixth semester of medialogy. It was
      made by a group consisting of me and two other students. Most of the code was written by me and I also designed the levels.
      One group member worked of the frog model, animations and controls, while another worked on UI and sound.
    </p>

      <p>Since the theme on the course was to create either an ECO game or a game that would somehow promote the 17 UN
        sustainabillty goals, we decided to create a game about a frog the would collect trash while on the journey to
        deliver a message to humans about the sad state of his forest. An interesting mechanic implemented for this game was the controls.
        Instead of using tranitaional WASD controls the player would instead have to click on the screen in the direction they wanted the frog 
        to jump and hold the mouse button the charge the jump.
      </p>

      <p>The game was creted in the Unity engine, and working on this project was another change to practice working with this, which i at this 
        point had gotten very familiar with. The final game was very much based on some early "quick and dirty" prototypes that i put together in
         a couple of days, so I found that working with the Unity Engine had become quite easy, compared to when a started using it back in 2015.

    <h2>Lumberjack Samurai (2022)</h2>
    <div class="container"><iframe class="youTube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67cPFdghtG0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
    <p> This game was created at the Nordic Game Jam 2022. The theme was "theme garden" meaning that everyone 
        had differnt themes determined by paper flowers that had to be chosen. The themes were divided into 
        categories by the color of the flowers. We decided to pick the category "mechanic" and picked the theme
        "cutting". This led to an idea about a samurai cutting trees.</p>

     <p>In the game it is all about cutting trees to gain exp and get to level 4 where you will be able to cut down 
        the Elden Tree. In level 1 the player can only cut down oak trees, then birch trees in level 2 and pine trees 
        in level 3.
    </p>

      <p>Since this game was made in less than 48 hours the gameplay is not that varied. I spent a lot of time
        getting the cutting of the meshes to work and the script for randomly generating most of the game elements. The
        game was made in a team of three people which all had designated roles. I was the Lead Programmer, and the other two
        were responsible for the assets and the UI.

    <h2>Candy Shoot (2021)</h2>
    <div class="container"><iframe class="youTube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xs41Dxso4k0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
    <p>This game was developed by me and a friend at a halloween game jam a AAU CPH in 2021. 
      The aim of the game was simple to make a fun halloween inspired shooter with lots of
      candy. The game was placed third in the category of Fun to Play, wihch was also the category
      we were going for this time around.</p>

    <p>In the game you wield a very cool halloween decorated deagle and you have to shoot appraching bats and 
      spiders in the dark, foggy and scary forest. When the enemies are shot candy is spread out fron them and
      scattered everywhere, the player must then to to collect as much of the candy as possible while continuing to shoot
      the enemies.  
    </p>

      <p>This game was done in less than 48 hours but i still managed to learn lot in process, i was responsible for all of
        the code and unity related stuff while my frind created the models. I learned about the unty nav meash system for the
        enies along with implementing smooth turning for them. A also worked with parts of the environment working with volumetric fog. 
        A more complete verison of the game is planned for a steam release by haloween this year. It will be an exteneded version of the
        game jam game and it will be a free to play title.

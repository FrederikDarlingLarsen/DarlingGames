    <h2>RollerBoy (2023)</h2>
    <div class="container"><img class="portfolio"  src="images/portfolioImages/final3.PNG" alt="roller"></div>
    <p>I started developing this game when i was still studing at university, but I had to 
      wait untill i finished my degree to have time to complete the game. During develipment, the
      core gamelay of the game have changed quite a lot at the future plans for development are very differnt
      than they were just a few months ago (written on march 2022).</p>

    <p>They game centers around a rolling ball character called RollerBoy. He has to complete many different varied
      levels i order to win. Every world that RollerBoy goes through is a new genre of play, which means that every
      type of player will be challenged at some point and that only true gamers will do well in the game.
    </p>

    <p>The plan is to release the game maybe some time in 2023, this depends on a lot of vairables and the game might have to
      be pushed further. The game will be released on Steam when it is time, more information will be shared when development
      is progressing.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The game can be played by clicking "Play RollerBoy" or by clicking on this link: <a href="rollerboy.html" target="_blank">RollerBoy Demo</a></p>
    <!-- <p>The game can also be found on itch.io following this link: <a href="https://frededarling42.itch.io/" target="_blank">RollerBoy itch.io page</a></p> -->

    <h2>Lumberjack Samurai (2022)</h2>
    <div class="container"><iframe class="youTube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67cPFdghtG0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
    <p> This game was created at the Nordic Game Jam 2022. The theme was "theme garden" meaning that everyone 
        had differnt themes determined by paper flowers that had to be chosen. The themes were divided into 
        categories by the color of the flowers. We decided to pick the category "mechanic" and picked the theme
        "cutting". This led to an idea about a samurai cutting trees.</p>

     <p>In the game it is all about cutting trees to gain exp and get to level 4 where you will be able to cut down 
        the Elden Tree. In level 1 the player can only cut down oak trees, then birch trees in level 2 and pine trees 
        in level 3.
    </p>

      <p>Since this game was made in less than 48 hours the gameplay is not that varied. I spent a lot of time
        getting the cutting of the meshes to work and the script for randomly generating most of the game elements. The
        game was made in a team of three people which all had designated roles. I was the Lead Programmer, and the other two
        were responsible for the assets and the UI.
    </p>

    <h2>Candy Shoot (2021)</h2>
    <div class="container"><iframe class="youTube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xs41Dxso4k0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
    <p>This game was developed by me and a friend at a halloween game jam a AAU CPH in 2021. 
      The aim of the game was simple to make a fun halloween inspired shooter with lots of
      candy. The game was placed third in the category of Fun to Play, wihch was also the category
      we were going for this time around.</p>

    <p>In the game you wield a very cool halloween decorated deagle and you have to shoot appraching bats and 
      spiders in the dark, foggy and scary forest. When the enemies are shot candy is spread out fron them and
      scattered everywhere, the player must then to to collect as much of the candy as possible while continung to shoot
      the enemies.  
    </p>

      <p>This game was done in less than 48 hours but i still managed to learn lot in process, i was responsible for all of
        the code and unity related stuff while my frind created the models. I learned about the unty nav meash system for the
        enies along with implementing smooth turning for them. A also worked with parts of the environment working with volumetric fog. 
        A more complete verison of the game is planned for a steam release by haloween this year. It will be an exteneded version of the
        game jam game and it will be a free to play title.
    </p>

    <h2>Star Tours 1987 VR (2021)</h2>
    <div class="container"><img class="portfolio"  src="images/portfolioImages/star tours.PNG" alt="star tours"></div>
    <p> DISCLAIMER: This is a Fan Project that will never be released due to copyright reasons. </p>

    <p>This is a Star Wars/Disneyland inspired fan projetct that a spent some itme working on due
      To my large interst in disney parks, star wars and the start tours ride in Disneyland specifically. 
      The point of the project which i am still working on is the recreate the original version of the 
      Star Tours Ride which has now been replaced by a new version of th ride in all of the disney parks.
    </p>

    <p>The project is created for VR since the plan is the make it a very immersive experince where the user
      will be able to feel like they are experiencing the original Star Tours ride in real life. Alot of effort
      was out into restoring the video shown inside the StarSpeeder 300 wihch was restored using deep learning AI
      upscaling sofware of video from differnt sources. some sources were very shaky requies alot of editng in
     Davinci Resolve mostly focusing on image stabilization.
    </p>

      <p>The main ride part of the project is alomst finished by could use some graphical updates. The paln now is
         the recrate te queue and maybe the outside area, along with implementing decent VR movement controls that
         do not cause motion sickness. Another plan to make the experice even more immersive is to implement 
         it with the Yaw VR motion simulator.

    <h2>Chad Game (2021)</h2>
    <div class="container"><img class="portfolio" src="images/portfolioImages/chad1.png" alt="chad game"></div>
    <p>This game was made at a small online game jam that functioned as a test for possible 
      bigger game jams at AAU. I worked on this game with one of my firend and it was made 
      in less than 48 hours.</p>

    <p>
      The game focused a lot on story and text. The game centers around the Virgin who wants to be like Chad. 
      He figures out through out the game that there are three things he needs to do. He needs to get an education, 
      a place to live and a girlfriend. When he has achieved all of this he will win at life.
    </p>

    <p>
      The game was not successful in accomplishing the most interesting gameplay, but i was a good learning process
      for the implementation of a basic text sytem and for at payer controller tat could move the player i 8 directions.
    </p>

    <h2>Turbo Cow (2018)</h2>
    <div class="container"><iframe class="youTube" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NarQksEx0M" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
    <p>I attended a game jam at Vallekilde Højskole in Holbæk in 2018 with some friends. We
      did not realize unitl we got there that almost all attendants were professional game developers,
      which meant that we got to see the working progress of differnt indie game while we worked on our own game.
      This jam lasted a bit longer than the usual 48 hours, which means that we go to spend more time making a game
      that was much better than what we had done on other jams.
    </p>

    <p>
      The game is a racing game, with procurally generated chunks of race track, where the player has to keep racing, 
      endless runner style in order to best the high score. The idea was to create a very stylixed game utilixing the 
      at the time relatively new HDRP(High Definition Render Pipeline) in Unity. We settled on a synthwave style game, 
      with a soundtrack to match. One intersting feture that was added was to be able to play the game in synth maode or
      8 bit mode. The would change the stlye of the music and a filter would be added to the screen in 8-bit to make it
      look like and old CRT monitor.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      For this game I worked primarily on the sound fx an the music. I got to play around with LMMS for the music. 
      We had some conversations about releasing the game on Steam, and chipped in a Steam direct page for the release. We
      never got to finish the game though, due to the three of us being busy with life stuff along with loosing interest in the project.

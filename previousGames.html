    <h2>Eco-Frog (2022)</h2>
    <div class="container"><iframe class="youTube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TF2mgvq-HMk" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
    <p>This game was developed on the Game Design course i took on the sixth semester of medialogy. It was
      made by a group consisting of me and two other students. Most of the code was written by me and I also designed the levels.
      One group member worked of the frog model, animations and controls, while another worked on UI and sound.
    </p>

      <p>Since the theme on the course was to create either an ECO game or a game that would somehow promote the 17 UN
        sustainabillty goals, we decided to create a game about a frog the would collect trash while on the journey to
        deliver a message to humans about the sad state of his forest. An interesting mechanic implemented for this game was the controls.
        Instead of using tranitaional WASD controls the player would instead have to click on the screen in the direction they wanted the frog 
        to jump and hold the mouse button the charge the jump.
      </p>

      <p>The game was creted in the Unity engine, and working on this project was another change to practice working with this, which i at this 
        point had gotten very familiar with. The final game was very much based on some early "quick and dirty" prototypes that i put together in
         a couple of days, so I found that working with the Unity Engine had become quite easy, compared to when a started using it back in 2015.

    <h2>Lumberjack Samurai (2022)</h2>
    <div class="container"><iframe class="youTube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67cPFdghtG0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
    <p> This game was created at the Nordic Game Jam 2022. The theme was "theme garden" meaning that everyone 
        had differnt themes determined by paper flowers that had to be chosen. The themes were divided into 
        categories by the color of the flowers. We decided to pick the category "mechanic" and picked the theme
        "cutting". This led to an idea about a samurai cutting trees.</p>

     <p>In the game it is all about cutting trees to gain exp and get to level 4 where you will be able to cut down 
        the Elden Tree. In level 1 the player can only cut down oak trees, then birch trees in level 2 and pine trees 
        in level 3.
    </p>

      <p>Since this game was made in less than 48 hours the gameplay is not that varied. I spent a lot of time
        getting the cutting of the meshes to work and the script for randomly generating most of the game elements. The
        game was made in a team of three people which all had designated roles. I was the Lead Programmer, and the other two
        were responsible for the assets and the UI.

    <h2>Candy Shoot (2021)</h2>
    <div class="container"><iframe class="youTube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xs41Dxso4k0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
    <p>This game was developed by me and a friend at a halloween game jam a AAU CPH in 2021. 
      The aim of the game was simple to make a fun halloween inspired shooter with lots of
      candy. The game was placed third in the category of Fun to Play, wihch was also the category
      we were going for this time around.</p>

    <p>In the game you wield a very cool halloween decorated deagle and you have to shoot appraching bats and 
      spiders in the dark, foggy and scary forest. When the enemies are shot candy is spread out fron them and
      scattered everywhere, the player must then to to collect as much of the candy as possible while continung to shoot
      the enemies.  
    </p>

      <p>This game was done in less than 48 hours but i still managed to learn lot in process, i was responsible for all of
        the code and unity related stuff while my frind created the models. I learned about the unty nav meash system for the
        enies along with implementing smooth turning for them. A also worked with parts of the environment working with volumetric fog. 
        A more complete verison of the game is planned for a steam release by haloween this year. It will be an exteneded version of the
        game jam game and it will be a free to play title.
